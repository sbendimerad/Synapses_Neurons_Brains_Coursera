## Question 7
**Action Potentials are the neurons output. Action potentials also known as spikes. These spikes are:**

- [x] Binary (digital) representation of the neuronal information; each spike is either "all" ("1") or "none" ("0")
- [ ] Analog representation of the neuronal information – larger spikes are capable to transmit more information.
- [ ] Although very important, we find them in very few nerve cells
- [ ] Important energy source for the cells

## Question 8
**Optogenetics is a new scientific method allowing:**

- [x] Activation (or inactivation) of specific cells (that were manipulated genetically) using light
- [ ] Simulating very large cortical networks consisting of 10^4 modeled neurons
- [ ] Changing the genetic code of neurons while recording from them
- [ ] Coloring of different cell types with different colors

## Question 9
**The neuron doctrine based on the work of Ramon y Cajal is a theory suggesting:**

- [x] The nervous system is constructed from discrete individual cells – neurons
- [ ] The signal between cells passes through chemical synapses
- [ ] Memories are created and saved in the brain
- [ ] Action potentials are generated due to the opening of membrane ion channels

## Question 10
**Choose the answer that corresponds to the correct order of values in A,B,C & D.**

- [ ] 10^11, 1, 10^4, 5*10^3
- [ ] 5*10^3, 1, 10^11, 10^4
- [ ] 10^4, 5*10^3, 10^11, 1
- [x] 10^11, 5*10^3, 10^4, 1

## Question 11
**Classification of neurons may be done using:**

- [x] Based on functional behavior (excitatory or Inhibitory cells)
- [x] Based on spiking activity pattern
- [x] Based on anatomical features (Pyramidal Cells, Chandelier cell, etc…)
- [x] Based on gene expression
- [x] Neurons with axons vs. neurons without
- [ ] Their color in a normal tissue

## Question 12
**Select the answer with the correct order of terms that match the spaces in the sentence below.**

- [ ] dendrite,vesicles,receptors,synapse,axon,neurotransmitters
- [ ] synapse,dendrite,axon,receptors,vesicles,neurotransmitters
- [ ] receptors,axon,dendrite,vesicles,neurotransmitters,synapse
- [ ] synapse,receptors,dendrite,vesicles,neurotransmitters,axon

## Question 13
**The age of the modern Human (Homo sapiens Sapiens) is:**

- [x] 200,000 years
- [ ] 2,000 years
- [ ] 20,000 years
- [ ] 2,000,000 years
- [ ] 20,000,000 years

## Question 14
**Using Brain Machine Interface(BMI):**

- [x] We may control a machine with the brain
- [x] We may control the brain (or parts of it) with a machine
- [x] We can stimulate the brain for treatment of Parkinson's - A disease related to an erroneous activity in the basal ganglia (a deep region in our brain)
- [x] We are creating a computer inspired by real neurons
- [ ] We developed treatment for multiple sclerosis - A disease caused by damage to the axonal myelin
- [x] We can simulate in the computer a whole cortical column consisting of 10,000 neurons
