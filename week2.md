# Quiz Answers

## Question 1
**Injection of a positive current into a neuron will:**

- [x] Charge the internal side of the membrane capacitance with positive ions
- [ ] Will not change the membrane voltage since the cell’s capacitor is sensitive only to the change in voltage (CdV/dt) rather to a constant current
- [x] Result with less negative membrane potential (depolarization)
- [ ] Lead to a more negative membrane potential (hyperpolarization)

## Question 2
**The following equation describes:**

- [ ] The minimal voltage (V=1−e^−t/RC) that may be attained during the injection of a step current I.
- [ ] The decay of membrane voltage in a passive isopotential cell following the ending of the injected step current.
- [x] The development of membrane voltage following a step current injection to a passive isopotential cell.
- [x] The maximal voltage (V=I∗R) that may be attained during the injection of a step current I.

## Question 3
**What is the membrane time constant - τm?**

- [ ] τm = V∗R
- [x] The time that it takes for the membrane potential to rise to about 63% of its steady state value following a long step current pulse.
- [x] The time that it takes for the membrane potential to reach 37% of its steady state value following a long current step.
- [ ] τm = I∗R
- [x] τm = R∗C

## Question 4
**Mark all the correct sentences**

- [x] The voltage in a passive RC circuit decreases exponentially at the end of the current injection.
- [ ] The voltage in a passive RC circuit decreases as (1-exponent) following the end of the current injection.
- [ ] The voltage in a passive RC circuit increases linearly with time following a step current injection.
- [ ] The voltage in a passive RC circuit increases as (1- exponent) during a step current injection (I) across the two sides of the circuit.

## Question 5
**What is a typical resting potential of a neuron?**

- [ ] −20mV
- [ ] +70mV
- [x] −70mV
- [ ] −70V
- [ ] −70μV
- [ ] 0mV

## Question 6
**What does the term “temporal summation” mean?**

- [x] The voltage response to repeated inputs to the cell will build up one response on top of the other.
- [x] The RC properties of neurons cause the neuron’s membrane to activate an ‘electrical memory” and thus, the voltage response to a later input may summate with that of an earlier input.
- [ ] The voltage response to two brief identical current pulses (I) to a cell is larger than the voltage to one continuous current pulse.
- [x] The timing of synaptic inputs to the cell determines the integration (summation) of these inputs.

## Question 7
**What is the direction of the (positive) current flow in the following circuit?**

- [ ] The direction depends on the magnitude of the resistance (conductance)
- [ ] Inward (from Out to In)
- [x] Outward (from In to Out)
- [ ] There will be no current at all

## Question 8
**Potassium (K+) concentration is higher inside the neuron than in the outside. The opening of potassium ion channels in the cell’s membrane will result in:**

- [x] Flow of K+ ions outside of the cell
- [ ] A flow of K+ ions into the cell
- [x] Hyper-polarization of the cell’s membrane
- [ ] Depolarization of the cell’s membrane

## Question 9
**Mark the correct sentences regarding the EPSP (Excitatory Post Synaptic Potential)**

- [x] The opening of transmitter-gated sodium channels will result with an EPSP
- [x] The EPSP results from the opening of synaptic (transmitter-gated) membrane ion channels associated with a positive battery
- [ ] Opening of transmitter-gated potassium channels will result with an EPSP
- [ ] EPSP results from the opening of synaptic channels associated with a (inward directed) negative battery

## Question 10
**Mark the correct sentences regarding the IPSP (Inhibitory Post Synaptic Potential)**

- [x] Opening of transmitter-gated potassium channels will result with an IPSP
- [ ] The IPSP results from the opening of synaptic (transmitter-gated) membrane ion channels associated with a positive battery
