- [x] The AP will become broader
- [ ] The AP can not be initiated
- [ ] The AP will become briefer
- [ ] The AP will continue indefinitely (will not repolarize to rest)

- [x] We may interpret the potassium ion channel as having 4 identical gates
- [ ] We may interpret the potassium ion channel as having 3 activated gates and one inactivated gate
- [x] Depolarizing the membrane will increase n

- [x] Opening of the outward K-conductance
- [ ] The opening of passive leakage channels
- [x] Inactivation of the sodium current due to the closing of the h-gate
