# Quiz Answers

## Question 1
**In the Held and Hein experiment (the two kittens experiment) only the active kitten could functionally see. Why?**

- [x] Vision is possible only when the brain successfully links between the movement it generates and the visual input it receives (the perception-action cycle)

## Question 2
**Sensory substitution implies that**

- [x] Utilizing a healthy sense for a lost sense (e.g., the somatosensory/tactile sense for vision in Braille reading)

## Question 3
**S. Ramon Y Cajal claimed that for the brain to learn:**

- [x] Some structural change must take place in the nervous system

## Question 4
**What is the Hebb hypothesis?**

- [x] The connection between the cells will strengthen if cell A is repetitively involved as one of the cells that activate Cell B

## Question 5
**The term synaptic plasticity describes:**

- [x] That existing synapses change their efficacy

## Question 6
**Biophysical experiments show that excitatory synapses strengthens/weakens as a function of the timing of pre- vs. postsynaptic spikes (STDP). Mark the correct sentences.**

- [x] In cortical/hippocampal pyramidal cells, when the pre synaptic cell fires a spike before the post synaptic cell – the excitatory synapses between these cells is strengthened (LTP) and vice versa for synaptic weakening (LTD)

## Question 7
**What is the time-window for the spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) mechanism?**

- [x] Tens of milliseconds

## Question 8
**What is the time-scale for long term potentiation (LTP) and depression (LTD)?**

- [x] Hours

## Question 9
**The two-photons microscope enables one to**

- [x] View new synapses forming during learning

## Question 10
**The EPSP amplitude measured in the soma of the post synaptic cell is increased by a factor of 2. What could be the underlying mechanism?**

- [x] Increasing the number of receptors in the post synaptic cell
- [x] Increasing the number of synapses between the pre- and post- synaptic cells
- [x] Increasing the number of neurotransmitters molecules released from the pre synaptic cell

## Question 11
**What do we know about changes in the brain related to learning?**

- [x] New dendritic spines with new synapse are created

## Question 12
**Is it feasible to copy memories from one brain to another (“disc on key”)?**

- [x] No as each of us stores/represents (codes for) memories in an individual way (different cells/different spike patterns in different brains).

## Question 13
**Is it possible in principle to physically erase memories?**

- [ ] Yes, because eventually memories are stored in all brains using the same synaptic mechanisms; destroying these synapses will erase the memory embedded.
- [ ] No, because we can not detect the region/networks associated with a particular memory
- [x] No because each of us stores/represents (codes for) memories in an individual way (different cells/different spike patterns in different brains)
- [ ] Yes, because when forming a memory the particular activity in the respective neural network could be monitored and then suppressed (memory will then be lost)
