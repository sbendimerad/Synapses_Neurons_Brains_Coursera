- [ ] Neurons in V1 recognize (respond strongly to) a particular face.
- [ ] Neurons in V1 of the cat are sensitive to moving spots of light.

## Question 3
**Mark the correct answers about McCulloch and Pitts (M&P) model:**

- [ ] M&P model considers the spatial extent of the dendritic tree.
- [x] M&P model considers the neuron as a logical device with ‘0” and “1” (output) state and with E (excitatory) and I (inhibitory) input synapses.
- [x] In M&P model E (excitatory) synapses implement OR operation and I (inhibitory) synapses AND NOT operation.
- [ ] M&P neuron makes use of the refractoriness of spike firing.

## Question 4
**Rall argued against the “point neuron” model because:**

- [ ] EPSP’s and IPSP’s cannot be explained under the “point neuron” assumption.
- [x] Dendrites are non iso-potential electrical distributed devices.
- [ ] Inhibition does not always veto the excitation.
- [x] A significant portion of the current injected to the soma flows to the dendrites and do not remain in the soma.

## Question 5
**A Current injected in the middle of a dendrite:**

- [ ] Will peak at the soma without a delay.
- [x] Will generate local voltage change which will attenuate with distance from the injection site.
- [x] Will flow in both directions (centripetally to the soma and centrifugally away from the soma).
- [ ] Will propagate only in the soma direction but with a delay.

## Question 6
**According to cable theory – mark all the correct sentences.**

- [x] At any location X, the change in axial current, is equal to the membrane current.
- [x] In short sealed-ended cylinders, voltage attenuates less steeply with distance compared to an infinitely long cylinder of same membrane properties and diameter.
- [x] Although the voltage change attenuates with distance from the dendritic input site to the soma, a significant portion of the synaptic current does reach the soma.
- [x] In passive dendritic trees, the shape of the transient synaptic potential will change with distance from the synaptic site.
- [x] The briefer the somatic EPSP, the more likely is that its origin is at distal location from the soma.

## Question 7
**Comparing excitatory synaptic input triggered distally with identical synapse triggered directly in the soma:**

- [x] At the soma, the amplitude of the EPSP form the distal synapse will be smaller.
- [x] At the soma the EPSP from the distal synapse will be broader.
- [ ] At the synaptic input site itself, the amplitude of the distal EPSP will be smaller than the EPSP originated at the soma.
- [ ] At the soma, the time-to-peak is shorter for the distal synapse.
- [ ] At the soma, the EPSP from the distal synapse will be narrower.

## Question 8
**Mark the correct sentences:**

- [x] Proximal inhibitory synapses are more global in their inhibitory effect (over excitatory synapses) than do more distal inhibitory synapses.
- [ ] The only computation that a neuron could perform is AND, OR and AND NOT logical operations.
- [x] Electrically distributed dendrites enable the neuron to perform local nonlinear operations (e.g., non-linear summation of synaptic inputs).

## Question 9
**Rall showed that:**

- [x] One could build a direction selective neuron using only passive dendrites and orderly activated excitatory synapses.
- [x] Activation of excitatory synapses in the distal-to-proximal temporal order results with a larger voltage change in the soma.
- [ ] Activation of excitatory synapses in the proximal-to-distal temporal order results in a delayed and broad EPSP at the soma.
- [ ] Activation of excitatory synapses in the proximal-to-distal temporal order results in a delayed and briefer EPSP in the soma.
- [ ] Activation of inhibitory synapses in the proximal-to-distal order will result with large depolarization in the soma.

## Question 10
**Enhanced optical resolution using two photon Ca+2-imaging (the work of Arthur Konnerth and team) has shown that:**

- [ ] A particular layer 2/3 pyramidal cell in mouse V1 interact synaptically only with cells having the same orientation selectivity.
- [x] That the orientation selectivity of an L2/3 cell may plastically change.
- [x] The synaptic inputs to an orientation selective cell in mouse V1 are orientation selective, with a variety of different orientation selective cells impinging of the post-synaptic L2/3 dendrites.
- [x] In V1 of the mouse, L2/3 cell are orientation selective.

## Question 11
**Using the “connectomics” technique for direction selective ganglion cell (DSGC) in the retina, it was found that:**

- [x] That more inhibitory contacts are formed on the dendritic side of the DSGs that is in the null direction of this DSGC.
- [ ] That the directional selectivity of DSGC cannot be explained based on the synaptic connectivity made onto its dendrites.
- [ ] The pre-synaptic inhibitory amacrine cells are uniformly connected to the dendrites of the DSGC.
- [ ] That more inhibitory contacts are formed on the dendritic side of the DSGs that is in the preferred direction of this DSGC.
