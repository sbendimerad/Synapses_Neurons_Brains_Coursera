- [ ] Only in the neocortex one finds pyramidal cells.
- [x] The neocortex typically consists of 6 layers.
- [x] In different brain regions, the neocortex is specialized in different computational tasks.

## Question 3

- [ ] There are ~ 300,000 neurons and ~10^8 synapses.
- [x] There are ~ 30,000 neurons and ~10^8 synapses.
- [ ] There are ~ 3,000 neurons and ~10^6 synapses.

## Question 4
**Layer 5 pyramidal cell in a mammalian neocortex:**

- [x] Receives input from different layers in the cortex.
- [ ] Receive only excitatory input from layer 4 spiny stellate cells.
- [ ] Its dendritic tree resides only at layer 5 of the neocortex.
- [x] Receives input from different types of cells.
- [x] May receive input also from neurons outside the cortex, sending their axon to the cortex.

## Question 5
**In the mouse barrel cortex:**

- [x] There is a clear anatomical separation among the columns.
- [ ] The computations performed within each column are isolated from those of other columns.
- [ ] The sensory information that reaches each column remains sensory throughout the whole brain of the mouse.
- [x] Each column receives primary input from a particular whisker.

## Question 6
**Input (axon) from the thalamus to the mouse barrel cortex:**

- [ ] Impinges only onto layer 4 of the cortex.
- [ ] Impinges mainly with layer 5.
- [ ] There is no direct connection between the thalamus (subcortical area) and the cortex.
- [x] Impinges mainly onto layer 4 of the cortex.

## Question 7
**Mark the correct sentences:**

- [x] As in the mouse whisker system, cat V1 also consists of anatomically-identified columns.
- [ ] Cells in cat V1 are plastic – experience can change the orientation selectivity of the column.
- [x] In cat V1 there are functional columns – most of the cells in the column respond to the same orientation of the visual input.
- [ ] The orientation of the column is defined by its physical orientation with respect to the skull.

## Question 8
**Different types of cells in the cortical column are different from each other in:**

- [ ] Different cell types have a different DNA sequence.
- [x] By their target output and by their synaptic effect (e.g., inhibitory/excitatory).
- [x] Their anatomy.
- [ ] Different cells have significantly different spike shape.
- [x] Their electrical characteristics.

## Question 9
**Models of a cells in the blue brain project (BBP) include:**

- [x] The cell electrical properties – a set of equations that replicates the firing properties of a similar cell in the cortex.
- [x] The cell morphology – the size and the location of its dendrites and axon.
- [ ] The synaptic properties impinging on other neurons in the network.
- [ ] Each cell is represented as a single compartment cell (“point neuron”).
- [ ] Simulations also include the activity of various genes and proteins.

## Question 10
**Simulation of a particular disease in the BBP means**

- [ ] That we can repair the disease via interaction between the computer simulation and the sick brain.
- [ ] That the spiking activity of different electrical-neuron types is replicated closely in the simulations.
- [x] That the simulation enables the identification of possible (synaptic, excitable or anatomical) changes underlying the disease.
- [ ] That the genes expressed in that disease are simulated in details.
- [ ] That the dynamic properties of the simulated network replicate closely to that of the corresponding disease.
