# Quiz Answers

## Question 1
**What are the main factors that limit the capability for “thoughts reading”?**

- [ ] It is impossible to read brain activity without intervening and thus changing it.
- [x] Not all brains are alike - Different brains code/represent specific details (e.g., particular face) differently. This implies that one must calibrate the reading machine (e.g., fMRI) to a specific brain.
- [x] The brain is very noisy, its response varies between repetitions of similar “thoughts”.
- [ ] Each person’s brain is built completely differently such different brain regions may be responsible for motor activity in one brain and to another activity in another brain.

## Question 2
**Mark the correct sentences about Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI):**

- [ ] Using fMRI we can detect the activity of a single neuron.
- [x] fMRI measures brain activity of different areas by detecting changes in blood flow.
- [x] A fMRI signal detects brain activity at a spatial resolution corresponding to the activity of millions of cells.
- [ ] fMRI measures brain activity by directly detecting electrical activity (action potentials).

## Question 3
**Mark the correct sentences:**

- [x] To date, it is impossible to write down an algorithm that outputs from a single fMRI or EEG trial, what particular face is being processed.
- [x] We may learn what face is particularly represented in the brain using calibration and repetitive fMRI.
- [x] Different brains detect faces in similar “object related” brain regions.
- [ ] Specific faces are represented similarly between different persons.

## Question 4
**Mark the correct sentences about the research by Semir Zeki and others regarding the neural correlates of beauty:**

- [ ] A Particular region in the brain is active when a portrait image is displayed.
- [ ] A Particular region in the brain is active when an abstract painting is displayed.
- [x] A Particular region in the brain is active for a (subjectively assessed) beautiful painting, independently of the painting category.
- [ ] “Beautifulness” is coded in enhanced activity at the orbito-frontal cortex and reduced activity in the motor cortex.

## Question 5
**Mark the correct sentence:**

- [ ] We can use fMRI signals to differentiate between the answer of a patient when he/she thinks on the words yes or no.
- [x] We can use fMRI signals to differentiate between “yes” and “no” by teaching the locked in patient to activate different regions in the brain corresponding to the desired answer.
- [ ] It is not possible to know today if a locked- in person may exhibit consciousness.
- [ ] Using fMRI, it will be possible in the near future to have a complete conversation in real time with a locked- in person.

## Question 6
**Mark the correct sentences about Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS):**

- [x] TMS is a noninvasive method that generates an electrical field in the brain, enabling the experimenter to induce activity in specific cortical neurons.
- [ ] TMS is being used medically to induce continuous improvement in motor activity.
- [x] TMS is a noninvasive method that enables the experimenter to induce activity in particular brain region.
- [x] TMS is being used to treat depression.

## Question 7
**From the case of Phineas Gage we may learn that:**

- [ ] we might have limited freedom to choose also with a non-injured brain.
- [x] Physical changes (damage) in the brain can induce change in personality.
- [ ] Psychological trauma can induce change in personality.
- [ ] Cage could choose to behave differently after his injury.

## Question 8
**According to the (EEG) experiments of Benjamin Libet:**

- [ ] That the reported time for the “will to move” coincides with the movement onset.
- [x] The movement-related brain activity starts seconds before we become aware that we “decided” to move.
- [x] There is time gap between the awareness (the will to move) and the onset of the movement.
- [x] That it is possible to read from brain activity at what time we decided to move (when we became aware of our decision).

## Question 9
**Using local stimulation in the brain:**

- [ ] We cannot trigger an action without the awareness of the subject to his own actions.
- [x] We can trigger the subject’s will to perform an action “conscious motor intention” and we can also trigger illusory movement (subject feels he moved, but he did not).
- [x] We may trigger an action without the subject’s awareness to the action.
- [ ] We can trigger the will to do an action but not the action itself.
- [ ] We can trigger the subject’s action but cannot trigger the subject
